# Particle Fallz
This edition of Particle Falls runs on a horizontal screen.

## Processing
This project requires Processing 3.

## Running

A `Makefile` is included which allows command line running of this
application. Simply type `make run` to run the project.

If your processing binary does not match the one in the makefile, *DO
NOT* change the definition of the one in the makefile. Simply run
`make run P2J=/path/to/processing-java` instead.
